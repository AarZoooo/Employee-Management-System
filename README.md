# Employee-Management-System
## Introduction
This is a mini-project where an Employee Management System is made using java. As this is a mini-project to be based on java and DSA, we have implemented ArrayList class instead of MySQL database. This program lets the user do a bunch of tasks with the employee data like Adding, Inspecting, Deleting, Sorting and Modifying.

## Working
This has a menu-driven approach for the interface. It starts off with offering the user the menus he can do, and asking for an input. Based on user input the program performs the tasks.
The Home Screen has the following options:
- Add Employee Data
- View Employee Data
- Modify Employee Data
- Sort Employee Data
- Delete Employee Data
- Exit
